# Pale Blue Dot Challenge
The Pale Blue Dot Challenge is a Nasa and Driven Data competition with the purpose to leverage open science and to make Earth observation data available to all.

## Introduction
This website has been developed for the Pale Blue Dot Challenge. Our group chose to create a visualization through a dashboard with data about the Climate Actions. Our goal is to relate factors like air temperature, greenhouse gases emissions and deflorestation.

### Run the project
The deploy version of this website is available in the link below:
[Pale Blue Dot Challenge Project](https://malumartins.github.io/pale-blue-dot-challenge/)

## Different pages
### 1. Dashboard
This page contains an overall view of all the data analyzed, including greenhouse gases emissions, vegetation, temperature and soil moisture indexes.

### 2. Maps
The map page contain the geographic representation for the data contained in the dashboard page.

### 3. Docs
The docs page contains important information about the challenge, the project and the data analysis process.

## Data analysis process code
The data analysis process is documented at ```/notebooks```.

### Scripts
The scripts to generate maps and charts are available at ```/src```.

### Datasets and fonts
The data analyzed and used to generate the charts is available in csv format files, at ```/data```.
